<h4>overview;</h4>
The Labrador Retriever is a medium to large-sized, short-coupled, 
powerfully-built dog with a short, dense, water-resistant coat;
 small, drop ears; and a short, thick otter-like tail carried level with the back or with a slight upward curve. 
The length of body is equal to or only slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the distance from the elbows to the ground is equal to one-half the height at the withers.
 Balance, outline, intelligence, temperament and movement are of overriding importance. 
<h4>History;</h4>
The ancestor of the Labrador Retriever was the St. John’s Retriever, a smaller version of the Newfoundland.
 These dogs were brought to England, probably on fishing boats. 
Gamekeepers crossed these Canadian imports with various breeds of gun dogs, always striving to improve the breed’s hunting and retrieving instincts. 
By the middle of the 19th century, 
the Labrador’s characteristic water-resistant coat and otter tail were already apparent.</td>
<td><h4>overview</h4>
The Frenchie shares many of the traits that made its bulldog ancestors so successful in the bull-baiting arena: low center of gravity, wide body, heavy bone, muscular 
build and large, square head.
 It has soft loose skin forming wrinkles about the head and shoulders. 
Unlike the bulldog, it has an alert, curious expression, which is aided by its bar ears. 
<h4>history</h4>
The French Bulldog originated in 19th Century Nottingham, England, where lace makers decided to make a smaller, miniature, 
lap version of the English Bulldog that was referred to as a "toy" bulldog. In the 1860s, when the Industrial Revolution drove the craftsmen to France, 
they took their dogs with them. The toy bulldogs became popular in France and were given the name the "French Bulldog." The breed eventually made its way back to England for dog shows.
 The Brits were not happy with the name "French" given to a dog that was originally from England, however the name "French Bulldog" stuck. </td>
<td><h4>overview;</h4>
The German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs, well-balanced, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a medium length coat, erect ears, and a low-set natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried in a slight curve like a saber. The outline of the German Shepherd Dog is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. The head is in proportion to the size of the body, strong without appearing coarse or fine. 
<h4>History</h4>
The German Shepherd Dog is a relatively young breed, developed almost single-handedly in the first half of the twentieth century by a German cavalry officer, Max von Stephanitz, president of the Verein far Deutsche Schaferhunde S.V. Using a variety of German sheepdogs as his foundation stock, von Stephanitz developed a distinctive breed in a very short period of time, due in large part to the authoritarian practices of the German dog fancy at that time. Von Stephanitz emphasized utility and intelligence in his breeding program, enabling the German Shepherd Dog to switch easily from herding duties to other fields of work, particularly military and police work. The breed was just gaining notice in the United States when World War I broke out.
